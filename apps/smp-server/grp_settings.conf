# Settings Management Group
# Enables MCUmgr handlers for reading/writing persistent settings
#
# NOTE: This is a TEST FIXTURE - security hooks are intentionally disabled for ease of testing.
# Production deployments should enable CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_SETTINGS_ACCESS_HOOK=y and implement
# proper access control callbacks. See:
# https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/device_mgmt/mcumgr_callbacks.html

# Enable settings subsystem
CONFIG_SETTINGS=y
CONFIG_SETTINGS_RUNTIME=y

# Enable settings management group
CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_SETTINGS=y
